# Front-end-To-Do-List


I have used HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

I have created a To-Do List app, where i have covered front-end part only, by using my application anyone can add all list of tasks that they have to do throughout the day.
I have used html for creating web pages , font-awesome for icons, CSS for style and JavaScript for "+" functionality and "delete" functionality of my app.
